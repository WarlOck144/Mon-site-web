	<h2>Caratéristique Personnelles</h2>
	<p>My name is Oscar Bouriot. I am 17 years old. I live in the center of Toulouse, near Francois Verdier station.
	I have 2 older brothers named Charles and Antoine.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Last year, I was a student at Saint Joseph La Salle High School in Toulouse, where I studied STI2D, 
	which stands for Science and Technologies of Industry and Sustainable Development.
	My focus was on IT Systems and Digital Engineering. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>As for my personality, I would describe myself as patient and optimistic.
	I believe that these qualities are essential in both my personal life and my studies, helping me face challenges calmly and with a positive mindset.

  <h2>Centre d'intérêt</h2>
  <p>I’m very passionate about snowboarding. 
  Every year, I go snowboarding in the mountains with my two older brothers. 
  Being in the mountains is like entering another world. 
  It’s a place where I feel completely free and at peace.

  <h2>Activité Extra-scolaire</h2>
  <p>One of my biggest passions is boxing.
  I’ve been practicing it for four years, and I’ve had the honor of becoming the Occitanie regional champion twice. 
  Boxing is a sport that requires a lot of discipline, and it has taught me how to stay focused and determined.

  <h2>Choix BUT R&T</h2>
  <p>I chose BUT because it's the closest to where I live, as well as having a good reputation and convincing results.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>I specifically chose the Networks and Telecommunications (R&T) BUT because I was initially hesitating between computer science and networks and telecoms.
  However, during the open house, I realized that the computer science program was mainly focused on coding,
  which doesn't really interest me. What's more, from the second year onwards, the R&T department offers a course in cybersecurity,
  a field that particularly appeals to me.
